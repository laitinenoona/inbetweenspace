<h1>IN BETWEEN SPACE</h1>
<H2>First post. Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my introduction and my visually stunning website.</p>
<p>I am just trying this out and see what happens.
Currently writing this code and this website on my notepad. This will propably be a disaster.
I have never written code before but I got really overwhelmed and annoyed by the options in 
the different website builders. Everything looked so fancy and new. I don't care for that.</p>
<p>How do I consume media? Poorly. I hate news and like to distance myself from them. I am
not a huge fan of social media either. I use it to entertainment purposes only. To watch funny videos and send memes to my friends.
I prefer slower forms of media like books and well.. Actually only books since I am not a huge fan of movies either.
This blog will propably be a mix of text, videos (if I find a way to implement videos into this code), poems and other forms
of creative writing.</p>
<br>
<p>Here. Have a look at this sad cat meme I wanted add to the page. It added it a bit too big but I am unsure on how to fix it yet.</P>

  <p>I am also really sorry if someone in this class actually knows how to code and create websites...</p>
<p>Best regards, Oona (14.9.2023)</p>
