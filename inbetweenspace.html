<h1>IN BETWEEN SPACE</h1>
<H2>First post. Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello</p>
<p></p>Welcome to my webpage. 
If you are wondering what is going on, I got overwhelmed by all the options 
in these ready-made website builders. 
Everything looked so fancy and new. 
And I don't really care for that to be honest.
The time will tell will this experiment be an absolute disaster or not.
I hope not. I am having an absolute blast already.</p>
<p>This blog will propably be a mix of text, thoughts, videos
(if I find a way to implement them into this code), and poems.</p>
<p>I am not a huge media consumer. Well, I watch instagram reels and send stupid
videos to my friends of course but that's about it. I don't follow the news
because they just make me depressed and sad. I much rather live in ignorance
apparently and I am quite content with that thought. I much rather consume 
slower forms of media like books and... Well actually only books since I don't
really care for movies or shows either. I watch maybe one Netflix show in 
a year.</p>
<br>
<p>Here. Have a look at this sad cat meme I wanted add to the page. It added it a bit too big but I am unsure on how to fix it yet.</P>

  <p>I am also really sorry if someone in this class actually knows how to code and create websites...</p>
<p>Best regards, Oona (14.9.2023)</p>
 <br>
<p>there is also this fancy comment box for you to write a comment. The comment box cannot be added twice since I copied to code
from the web. I am sorry.</p>

 <h1>SECOND POST: STUDENT OCCUPATIONS AND INSTAGRAM</h1> 
  <br>
  <p>This is not the first time a university has been occupied. In 1968 a group of leftist students occupied the Old Student House (Vanha Ylioppilastalo) in Helsinki on the eve of University of Helsinki’s 100th year celebrations. On the 1968 occupation the students demanded changes to universities government policies and to the content of the studies.</p>
<p>This time around students demand basic rights as human beings and protest against the government's unfair policies and cuts on welfare, that most affect the people who are already in a vulnerable position in society to begin with like students, poor and the ill.</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Vanhan-valtaus-1968b.jpg" alt="vallattu ylioppilastalo" width="600" height="800">
  <p>What do these two occupations have in common? 1968 occupiers are called to be radical leftist but the occupation were said to go fluently and peacefully, and the occupiers even cleaned after themselves when they left. Yet again, the current student occupation is a very peaceful one. People are constantly told to take care of themselves, rest, drink water, eat and so on. It is all in all bodily experience to be part of the occupation. It is rough and tiresome, it is exactly what the current government wants to happen: people giving up their right to protest and being too tired to try.</p>
<p>I am interested in the thought that does these occupations change the course of government politics and stay in the history books and how much does social media have to do with everything? The 1968 occupation changed the course on leftist politics and student politics in Finland. It was also part of the larger student movement in the world criticizing for example The Vietnam war and bourgeois society. But does peaceful demonstration make a difference in the world? At least the current government really wants to restrict the right to protest in Finland currently, making it hard to get up and show up. The protesters means must match their ends. If we call for warmth, humane treatment for all and solidarity, we cannot drive those values through with violence and destruction.</p>
<p>Social media is a big part of the current occupation. It started from the University of Helsinki and spread through social media pages, mainly instagram. And now we have a nationwide protest arranged in a week and we get to thank social media for it.  I think it would not have been possible to achieve this without the use of social media. In cases like these we see social media's side and power to bring people together in a short period of time, to get excited about something and the willingness to make a change.</p>
<p>In 1968 the protests spread throughout the globe but in a much slower manner. Right now it is possible to arrange students to protest on a very short notice. I can imagine that in 1968 the occupation of Vanha Ylioppilastalo took a lot more effort and planning to execute and succeed.</p>

   <h1>THIRD POST: ARISTOTLE AND THE CLASH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL</h1> 
  <p>One of the most influential pieces of literature in literature sciences and esthetics is Aristotle’s Poetics. Poetics is the earliest surviving Greek theory in drama and literature criticism. It is an enormously influential piece of writing in a western philosophy and in esthetics. But what does this piece of literature have to do with Hollywood films and especially the narratives of good and evil, hero protagonist and the clear thoughts of right and wrong? Well, a lot apparently. </p>
  <P>First of all the idea of clear cut good and evil has a lot to do with Christianity and The Bible to begin with. There is no such thought in Greek mythology, nor does those themes rise to the surface in Greek dramas. There is no good and evil, no light and dark, no clear sense of right and wrong in the early days of drama, written in Athens 400 BC. Those thoughts came later with the influence of Christianity and later enforced strongly with Hollywood narratives. Even in today’s class, when we discussed stories, the thought of a clash between good and evil and a strong protagonist rose to the conversation and was said to be an essential part of a narrative, even though it is not a sure thing to have those in a good story. Hollywood has just influenced our perception on what we consider good narrative.  </P>
 <P>It is also strange that these grandiose narrative structures are sold to us with the thought that they are sempiternal and that they have been part of good storytelling for forever, even though that is not the case. The visual culture around us is just so influenced by Hollywood and few theories on how to structure a narrative that we tend to forget that that has not always been the way people wrote drama. Also these grandiose narratives might just be really successful in a sense that people find them intriguing, but it does not mean that they are the only ones that exist.</P>

  <P>But let’s get back to Aristotle. What then was something that was valued in ancient Greece in drama and writing? In Poetics there is no support to the claim that in a successful and good drama there is supposed to be a strong protagonist and a clash between the said protagonist and these greater forces. Aristotle also does not support the thought that the protagonist is either good or evil. Aristotle seems to think that characters whose personality stays the same through and throughout are better. There is also no notion of the thought that a person or a protagonist gets what they want if they just try hard enough. Sometimes the will and skill is not enough to get what you want. There is a lot more middle ground and shades of gray in Greek dramas, and sometimes the plot is about the inner conflict that the person has with the thoughts of good and evil for example, but the thoughts are not divided into these polarized categories.</P>

  <p>If we take the thought of will and skill and bring it to the 21st century we can read Aristotle almost as a criticism of our individual driven society. We are taught from the very beginning that we get what we want by being productive, hustling away, and acquiring skills to do so. We are driven by the thought that an individual can do anything if they set their mind to it. Aristotle basically is saying no, that is not how it goes. You might be brilliant and still end up with a disappointment in your hands. Also the point of narrative or tragedy is not to teach you how to overcome yourself and become a higher being (that thought we might get into with Nietzsche later in this blog) but just wake the feelings of fear and empathy and compassion in a viewer. </p>
