<h1>IN BETWEEN SPACE</h1>
<H2>First post. Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello</p>
<p></p>Welcome to my webpage. 
If you are wondering what is going on, I got overwhelmed by all the options 
in these ready-made website builders. 
Everything looked so fancy and new. 
And I don't really care for that to be honest.
The time will tell will this experiment be an absolute disaster or not.
I hope not. I am having an absolute blast already.</p>
<p>This blog will propably be a mix of text, thoughts, videos
(if I find a way to implement them into this code), and poems.</p>
<p>I am not a huge media consumer. Well, I watch instagram reels and send stupid
videos to my friends of course but that's about it. I don't follow the news
because they just make me depressed and sad. I much rather live in ignorance
apparently and I am quite content with that thought. I much rather consume 
slower forms of media like books and... Well actually only books since I don't
really care for movies or shows either. I watch maybe one Netflix show in 
a year.</p>
<br>
<p>Here. Have a look at this sad cat meme I wanted add to the page. It added it a bit too big but I am unsure on how to fix it yet.</P>

  <p>I am also really sorry if someone in this class actually knows how to code and create websites...</p>
<p>Best regards, Oona (14.9.2023)</p>
 <br>
<p>there is also this fancy comment box for you to write a comment. The comment box cannot be added twice since I copied to code
from the web. I am sorry.</p>

 <h1>SECOND POST: STUDENT OCCUPATIONS AND INSTAGRAM</h1> 
  <br>
  <p>This is not the first time a university has been occupied. In 1968 a group of leftist students occupied the Old Student House (Vanha Ylioppilastalo) in Helsinki on the eve of University of Helsinki’s 100th year celebrations. On the 1968 occupation the students demanded changes to universities government policies and to the content of the studies.</p>
<p>This time around students demand basic rights as human beings and protest against the government's unfair policies and cuts on welfare, that most affect the people who are already in a vulnerable position in society to begin with like students, poor and the ill.</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Vanhan-valtaus-1968b.jpg" alt="vallattu ylioppilastalo" width="600" height="800">
  <p>What do these two occupations have in common? 1968 occupiers are called to be radical leftist but the occupation were said to go fluently and peacefully, and the occupiers even cleaned after themselves when they left. Yet again, the current student occupation is a very peaceful one. People are constantly told to take care of themselves, rest, drink water, eat and so on. It is all in all bodily experience to be part of the occupation. It is rough and tiresome, it is exactly what the current government wants to happen: people giving up their right to protest and being too tired to try.</p>
<p>I am interested in the thought that does these occupations change the course of government politics and stay in the history books and how much does social media have to do with everything? The 1968 occupation changed the course on leftist politics and student politics in Finland. It was also part of the larger student movement in the world criticizing for example The Vietnam war and bourgeois society. But does peaceful demonstration make a difference in the world? At least the current government really wants to restrict the right to protest in Finland currently, making it hard to get up and show up. The protesters means must match their ends. If we call for warmth, humane treatment for all and solidarity, we cannot drive those values through with violence and destruction.</p>
<p>Social media is a big part of the current occupation. It started from the University of Helsinki and spread through social media pages, mainly instagram. And now we have a nationwide protest arranged in a week and we get to thank social media for it.  I think it would not have been possible to achieve this without the use of social media. In cases like these we see social media's side and power to bring people together in a short period of time, to get excited about something and the willingness to make a change.</p>
<p>In 1968 the protests spread throughout the globe but in a much slower manner. Right now it is possible to arrange students to protest on a very short notice. I can imagine that in 1968 the occupation of Vanha Ylioppilastalo took a lot more effort and planning to execute and succeed.</p>

   <h1>THIRD POST: ARISTOTLE AND THE CLASH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL</h1> 
  <p>One of the most influential pieces of literature in literature sciences and esthetics is Aristotle’s Poetics. Poetics is the earliest surviving Greek theory in drama and literature criticism. It is an enormously influential piece of writing in a western philosophy and in esthetics. But what does this piece of literature have to do with Hollywood films and especially the narratives of good and evil, hero protagonist and the clear thoughts of right and wrong? Well, a lot apparently. </p>
  <P>First of all the idea of clear cut good and evil has a lot to do with Christianity and The Bible to begin with. There is no such thought in Greek mythology, nor does those themes rise to the surface in Greek dramas. There is no good and evil, no light and dark, no clear sense of right and wrong in the early days of drama, written in Athens 400 BC. Those thoughts came later with the influence of Christianity and later enforced strongly with Hollywood narratives. Even in today’s class, when we discussed stories, the thought of a clash between good and evil and a strong protagonist rose to the conversation and was said to be an essential part of a narrative, even though it is not a sure thing to have those in a good story. Hollywood has just influenced our perception on what we consider good narrative.  </P>
 <P>It is also strange that these grandiose narrative structures are sold to us with the thought that they are sempiternal and that they have been part of good storytelling for forever, even though that is not the case. The visual culture around us is just so influenced by Hollywood and few theories on how to structure a narrative that we tend to forget that that has not always been the way people wrote drama. Also these grandiose narratives might just be really successful in a sense that people find them intriguing, but it does not mean that they are the only ones that exist.</P>

  <P>But let’s get back to Aristotle. What then was something that was valued in ancient Greece in drama and writing? In Poetics there is no support to the claim that in a successful and good drama there is supposed to be a strong protagonist and a clash between the said protagonist and these greater forces. Aristotle also does not support the thought that the protagonist is either good or evil. Aristotle seems to think that characters whose personality stays the same through and throughout are better. There is also no notion of the thought that a person or a protagonist gets what they want if they just try hard enough. Sometimes the will and skill is not enough to get what you want. There is a lot more middle ground and shades of gray in Greek dramas, and sometimes the plot is about the inner conflict that the person has with the thoughts of good and evil for example, but the thoughts are not divided into these polarized categories.</P>
  <img src="https://www.thecuriousreader.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Greek-Theatre-feature-imageArtboard-5.png">
  <p>If we take the thought of will and skill and bring it to the 21st century we can read Aristotle almost as a criticism of our individual driven society. We are taught from the very beginning that we get what we want by being productive, hustling away, and acquiring skills to do so. We are driven by the thought that an individual can do anything if they set their mind to it. Aristotle basically is saying no, that is not how it goes. You might be brilliant and still end up with a disappointment in your hands. Also the point of narrative or tragedy is not to teach you how to overcome yourself and become a higher being (that thought we might get into with Nietzsche later in this blog) but just wake the feelings of fear and empathy and compassion in a viewer. </p>

  <h1>FOURTH POST: I DONT DREAM OF LABOR -- TALES FROM YOUTUBE </h1>
<P>I have been reading this book called “The problem with work: Feminism, marxism, antiwork politics and postwork imaginaries” by Kathi Weeks and it got me thinking. Why do we work and more necessarily why do we not question the chokehold work as a concept has on us as a society?</P>
<p>The book is yet unfinished but with the concept of anti-work I went down the Youtube rabbit hole and dove into video essays from people with a hashtag “I don’t dream of labor”. There is a surprising number of entries under the title/hashtag and a lot of them are people telling about their experiences with work and how they do not want to grind away the 9-5 life anymore, that they are tired of working and being always stressed. But what strikes me as fascinating in these videos is that they do not really question the work as a concept itself, only the kind of work we do. The videos are critical of the grind and hustle culture and workload, but usually as an alternative, the videos suggest we just move on to more “fun work” or “enjoyable labor”. This got me thinking: is it possible for us to imagine our society without labor in general? What could come after?</p>
<p>It is not just innocent youtuber’s who have problems thinking outside of the work paradigm. Even probably the most famous critic of capitalism, Karl Marx, includes in his communist utopia some form of work that people do. The workload is just divided differently and no one has a lot of power and resources above others. But I am interested in the thought and what if’s of if work didn’t exist in our society. Or if i refrace: If work as it is did not exist. It is almost unbelievable what kind of hold does capitalism have over our sense of freedom and even self. From the very beginning we are taught that there are jobs and people need to work to make a living and even our whole education system is there to mold us into lawful citizens who are ready to enter the workforce as soon as possible. And the system where you have to decide your study objectives at the ripe age of fifteen is not really helping anyone to be less stressed about their future. We are also taught that people who do not work, or cannot get a job, are lazy, useless and a burden to our society.</p>

  <p>If you start to think about it, a lot of the jobs nowadays are just to support the mechanisms of over consumption and deepen the ecological crisis going on. What would happen if we would remove all the jobs related to consumption and businesses that are here only to profit from scarce resources we have? What would we have on our hands? A large number of people with a lot of idle time in their hands at least, I imagine. I’d like to imagine a world where you can choose if you want to work or not and not be convicted into poverty and homelessness if you choose not to spend all your time working. To be honest, if presented with the choice, I think many would still choose work. It would take a lot of work (pun intended) to move the general public’s opinion on the paradigm of work into something else. Capitalism is that deeply rooted in our thinking that we have a hard time imagining for example a world with a liveable basic income that is not solely dictated by slaving away 40 hours per week.</p>

  <h1>FIFHT POST: JORDAN PETTERSON, ANDREW TATE AND POSTMODERNISM: WHEN NOTHING IS ANYTHING ANYMORE AND THE CRISIS OF MASCULINITY</h1>
<P>You have probably seen or heard the videos by Jordan Petterson, Andrew Tate, or their fanboys and cult followers on different social media platforms. Let’s just say at the very beginning that this text will be biased against these videos and creators and I won’t even try to be unbiased, nor act that my analysis is somewhat ”objective”, because it most certainly is not. On a side note I also feel like these creators, especially Jordan Pettersson, always try to mask their biased and hurtful opinions as ”objective facts” and I will try to avoid that by being open about my biases.
</P>
  <P>But let’s start with the ism that has ruined the world according to neo-conservatives: postmodernism. Postmodernism is a way of thinking that is defined by the thought that no belief structure is coherent and objective, that there is no universal truth or objective rationality. Also the will and want to deconstruct for example hierarchies, power structures and binary opposites. If you take the thought to extreme, it means that nothing is anything anymore, except maybe very subjective notions on how the world works. In other words, postmodernism stands for everything that these neo-conservative white men who preach objective truth, strong binary gender ideology and rigid power structures, hate. </P>
<P>In the 21st century many of you have probably observed the rise of far-right politics, conservatism and setbacks on human rights, for example lgbtq rights and rights to abortion. On social media creators like Andrew Tate have risen to fame in Tik Tok by creating misogynistic, racist, sexist and far-right content that is usually designed for young boys and teenagers. What is very common in Tate’s videos is this thought on objective truth and masking his very hurtful opinions as facts and people who criticize these said ”facts” are labeled as feminazis or dumb liberals, who do not understand ”how this world works”. Even though if you analyze Tate’s opinions you can see there is a clear pattern on how far-right opinions are usually constructed. First of all, the rise on neo-conservative opinions in the media has probably emerged against the postmodernist thought that there is nothing certain in the world. An individual might feel threatened by the notion that there is nothing certain and old power structures, where masculinity has ruled for centuries, are crumbling.
</P>
  <P>The thoughts and easy answers Andrew Tate and Jordan Petterson provide appeals to some men because their audience might feel that men and their problems are ”forgotten” because of feminism and these crumbling power structures. Petterson and Tate give these easy, essentialist, answers to the men who feel disregarded by feminism and postmodernist thoughts. Basically they preach how these insecure, forgotten, teenagers and boys have essence, significance and purpose, which is a very appealing thought to someone who battles with their identity and insecurities. And they do this argumentation with confidence and an ”alpha-male” attitude, which is charming to people who have tendencies to think that men are superior, or are taught this idea by patriarchy, and are usually too young to critically analyze their own thought patterns. Tate and Petterson are also good at spinning arguments to benefit their views and make the other person look foolish. </P>
<P>I could go into length on how feminism is for men et cetera but I am in reality very tired of trying to argue these points to people who think that Peterson’s and Tate’s opinions are right and superior. In this post I just want to make the point that these opinions too have roots somewhere and they have not been born in a vacuum. One should always be critical of arguments that seem a bit too good to be true and appeal to one’s emotions and insecurities.</P>

<h1>SIXTH POST: ”HOW CAN A FOUNDATION SUPPORT PEOPLE SITTING ON THE STREETS!? I WILL BOYCOTT ELEVATORS FROM NOW ON!”</h1>
  <p>The Extinction Rebellion’s Forest Rebellion started on 15th of September and in August a few weeks prior Kone Foundation (one of the biggest foundations in Finland who gives out grants for artists and scientists) supported the Forest Rebellion with a grant of 200 000 euros. A historical sum to support activism, especially forest activism, in Finland. And of course this caused an uproar among some people in the comment section of the newspapers like Aamulehti, Helsingin Sanomat and Maaseudun Tulevaisuus. Probably no need to say but I found this discourse very amusing and also a bit disturbing. Let me explain.</p>
  <p>I swear this blog is not just a space to hate on men or men-perceived individuals, but I am saying that many people who reaaaaally disliked the Kone’s decision to support the Forest Rebellion had men sounding names and people who supported the decision had women sounding names in the comment sections. There is a peculiar notion here, in general, how activism, animal rights and nature are still coded very feminine in our society like for example not eating meat, caring for animals and nature and so on. I can’t help but to come to the conclusion that some men only dislike activism, nature and veganism because of the notion that those phenomena are coded very feminine. It is still perceived feminine to care and have empathy and someone might think it is also emasculating to be associated with feminine phenomena. Which is very very saddening and worrisome to see. (Also if you take a look at my previous post, that is also part of the problem with the crisis of masculinity: lack of empathy and respect for feminine phenomena)</p>
<p>Also the care for nature and the burden of environmental activism usually falls on the shoulders of people who already care a lot about the environment, government policies and are not part of the comfortable middle class. I also can’t help to imagine that probably many of the critics of Kone’s decision in the news websites are part of the middle class who do nothing to prevent the climate crisis with their own actions and keep on living their comfortable middle class lives with regular holidays abroad, driving cars and eating meat for example. They are critical of the Extinction Rebellion because they only see the inconveniences that civil disobedience causes to their commute to work with their new electric car. They do not seem to see the bigger picture and the fact that in an environmental crisis there soon won’t be anyone driving those electric cars around to begin with.

<h1>SIXTH POST BONUS: NATIONAL FOREST (S)TRAGEDY</h1>
<P>This is the limit. Between madness and remembrance. I remember the playfulness of the light. Shade of the branches and silent gurgle. I wanted to be far away from here and nowhere else. Did I corrupt you with breathing our shared air? You were here before eternity. Or the times that felt like one. I am seeking my lost time; when there was a possibility to choose differently.</P>
  <P>One day we remember. The lost days and lost times. Back when the action could have taken place. Now what we have left of this virgin forest? The pixels on the screen, which are a spare comfort for our lungs that breathe the air we created. I waited for something to happen, but nothing came. Only silence and wind blowing in my ears even though I have not paid it much attention in years. I was not scared then but I learned to be scared in time; scared of the same air in my lungs that we inhaled and made us so sick.
</P>
  <P>We cut you down. We tore apart your roots and your oxygen, out of the mother earth. Only for our own comfort we tore apart these lands, not realizing it is the exact same land that we inhabit. We documented your existence for the future generations, like that would be enough. Now you exist in my memories, in remembrance. The better days that I try to recall every time I am stuck inside. 
</P>
  <P>Frantically I try to clean my past, the crimes I committed against you. In my defense it was not just me. It was the whole system that was against your peaceful existence. Not just me, they cut you down and used you as a fuel, as a way of escaping burning fossils and crackling coals. Not realizing you were not a source of never-ending energy and capital. Everything has its limits but this is something our system never gets right. No matter if it is you or me, my time and psyche, or your roots and branches, it is never enough for them. There is always something more to exploit, kill, and bring to the brink of extinction.
</P>

  <h1>SEVENTH POST: JOHN DEWEY, INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY AND SECOND SCREENING </h1>
  <P>I will sound like an old and really boring person when I say this but our mindless indulgence of media is making us lack creativity, deep thinking and it is ruining our attention span . Our media consumption and media trends grow faster and faster everyday. The amount of short content like tiktok, reels and shorts has skyrocketed and even within these short contents, creators are doing even shorter clips and videos to grasp the attention of someone in the first two seconds of the video to increase the likes and views.</P>
  <P>Last week in our reading circle we finished the book by John Dewey called Art as experience which is a philosophical text on perception, esthetics and well, like the title states, art as experience. Dewey’s book is based on the lectures he gave in Harvard in the 1930’s. A lot of the things Dewey wrote in the book seem really relevant even in today's environment and the age of social media. Firstly Dewey defines aesthetic experience as something where we can observe a clear halt on the experience and its themes, we problematize the topic and themes in our mind and it is not just passive indulgence. Dewey also thinks a good experience is an experience that stays with us and we think about it even after the immediate exposure. Dewey’s thoughts especially on the character of aesthetic experience sounds a lot like a contradiction to how we indulge media nowadays.</P>
<P>In the afterthought of John Dewey I started to think how in today’s environment it is really easy to just mindlessly scroll through different social media platforms, to consume content that is in nature visual but not aesthetic, if we understand aesthetic how Dewey defines it up above. Algorithms, social media and the sheer amount of visuals that we are exposed to every single day makes it almost impossible to have these deep aesthetic experiences and only mindlessly scroll and consume media. There is also the notion on how the society and the way our media is structured nowadays do not make intellectual curiosity easy or plausible. Just the overflowing visuality, colors, pictures, videos, tiktoks etcetera entices us to be passive and unproblematic.</P>
<P>Where I originally got the idea for this post was the thought of screenwriters writing their scripts with the thought of “second screening” in mind. By this I mean that the writers dumb down their scripts and dialogue in order to make it possible to follow the TV show or movie while “second screening” aka scrolling on your phone at the same time watching tiktoks. The writers compromise their creativity and ideas just for the sole purpose of giving people the feeling they understand the show even though they do not give it their full attention. </P>

  <h1>EIGHT POST: STRATEGIC IGNORANCE AND OPINIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>
  <p>Few days after the devastating news from Israel/Palestine war actions I encountered several pieces of writing on social media that claimed that if you do not ”make noise” about the war crimes you are supporting the claim of Israel and therefore supporting the war and colonial actions of Israel. And it got me to think: does it truly make a difference if an individual chooses to take or not take part in a discussion (especially on the heavy topics like war) on social media? I wish I would have on hand the original posts I saw but we are talking about Instagram here, where it is almost impossible to find past information, so sorry for that. </p>
<p>Let’s just state at the very beginning that I have made the clear-cut decision to keep politics out of my socials, so I might be very biased writing this but bare with me. I do not post political content on my page or stories and I also try to disengage from purely political content on social media sites like Reddit, Instagram or Youtube. I do read the news on occasion to keep up with what is happening in the world though. I act like this even though my ”social bubble” is very considerate on social issues and posts a lot of content when crises in the world arise. So the question is: am I just strategically ignorant on social issues and stay quiet because of my own comfort or is there really a need for everyone to contribute to the world's issues on their social media platforms?
</p>
  <p>I am skeptical of the notion that everyone should contribute the same information in social media by sharing posts and stories. It easily results in information fatigue and everything you see, hear and read becomes indifferent. Should we give more space to people who produce activism content or content on social issues for living on social media then? Well unfortunately that solution might not be the silver bullet we are looking for. There are few problems that come to mind on the topic of relying too much on the opinions of experts. Firstly, they might have a lot of unknown biases even though they are experts. For example, on the topic of Gaza, how much information has some sort of attachment to colonialist way of thinking and the habit of thinking that western world and whiteness are the golden standards of life? Even though no expert probably directly states so, there still might be deep rooted thoughts on western supremacy and whiteness at play. Social media can be a powerful tool to showcase these kinds of thoughts but due to the nature of social media, even the good thoughts might get buried under the loads of information.</p>
<p>The original question could have a different outcome if one would have many followers on their social media platforms. But even if one would have a substantial following on social media, is your opinion the one everyone needs to hear? I am very skeptical of influencers being the relied experts on every field, when all they can probably contribute is to read a few news articles about the topic at best and then give out their ”expertise” on topics. To be fair this ”influencers as experts” is the other end of the spectrum on this topic and there are shades of gray in between. The post is already quite long, so I think I will save the analysis on my own social media behavior to the next post. There I will better answer the question: do I think my opinion is needed when these burning topics arise on social media. Ironically in a blog I run. </p>
<p>It is important to note though that being empathetic and showing care for people's suffering in social media is different from trying to mask your superficial knowledge as expertise. Anyone can, and probably should, show empathy and care on social media more than is shown nowadays. Empathy is a powerful tool to utilize when conflicts in the world rises and human suffering is at stake. </p>

  <h1>NINTH POST: COGNITIVE PROTOTYPE OF A STORY AND NARRATIVES OF WAR</h1>
  <p>Last week I wrote some rambling thoughts about the war between Israel and Palestine and this week I think I will delve a bit deeper into the narratives built in the media about the war. First I will go through thoughts about narratology and what is a cognitive prototype of a story and how these theories might help us understand the narratives built in the media about war. Secondly I will briefly use the war in Ukraine as a case example and compare its narratives to the Israel-Palestine
 war. 
</p>
  <p>Narratology and its rise to fame started back in the 90’s when suddenly the talk about narrative and stories were everywhere. Before the change, in structuralist narratology (the old school narratology), the basis was a will to create an universal model for a story. ”One story to rule them all” if you wish. Even though classic, structuralist, narratology still lives on, in some ways we have moved towards post-structuralist narratology where the story is understood as a cognitive model instead of a big grandiose universal model. In post structuralist narratology what matters is how humans understand and experience the story. It is very appealing to think about stories in a cognitive sense — how does it feel to be a certain person in a specific instance? This cognitive turn can also be seen as a part of the rising self help trend and individualism in society. There is the underlying thought on how a person can always control one’s mind but not things like war, environment or capitalism. </p>
<p>Cognitive prototype of a story refers to a narrative where for example human life is understood as a structured time based continuity of singular events. This sentence is easiest understood in a context of burnout: think about a post burnout experience where an individual experiences a significant halt in their daily life (one day where after one specific day nothing goes right and the individual just fails to succeed time and time again.) This models us a story where an individual fights their way through disappointment and failure towards victory and success.
</p>
  <p>Well you might ask how this all has to do with war? Well wars nowadays are more or less fought in the media as well as in the battle zones. This started already back in the Vietnam war, which was the first war in history that was well documented and televised. In Ukraine right now we see a certain narrative: on the other hand there is Putin, Russia’s propaganda, and control over media and on the other hand Ukraine, Zelensky, and social media. Western media likes to build a narrative from this initial setting, which is very black and white. Russian people are faceless, very masculine and strong war machines that do not have emotions and are clear-cut enemies. While Ukrainians are little and innocent humans that are on the good side of events and history defending humanity. </p>
<p>I first took the war in Ukraine as a case example because I think it is really interesting how western media portrays the war in Ukraine versus how the war in Israel-Palestine territory is portrayed. Let’s face it, the mainstream media has clearly took quite strong pro-Israel stance on the conflic in Gaza. There is complete radio silence in mainstream western media about the crimes that Israeli people commit, instead they are portrayed as the victims of the whole conflict. If you pay attention also to the language that is used, it is always so that the crimes that Palestinians commit are littered with action verbs like ”killed”, ”attacked”, ”destroyed” and when Israel people commit crimes events happen in passive, for example ”hospital attack in Gaza”. The language is a strong component in building different narratives and I think the western media also plays cleverly with the underlying racism in the west toward muslims. The media portrays muslims as terrorists, killers, attackers, as a faceless mass of people who do not feel pain, suffering, or loss of their children.

  <h1>TENTH POST: SOCIAL REPRODUCTION AND ART</h1>
  <P>This week we are once again inspired by books and well, capitalism. Currently I am reading a book by Tithi Bhattacharya, Social Reproduction Theory: Remapping Class, Recentering Oppression. The book is about social reproduction, crisis of care and its implications on class, gender and capitalism. Let’s start with a brief summary on what social reproduction means.</P>
<P>Social reproduction refers to reproduction of life itself and that reproduction is apart from production of goods and services that capitalism produces. In other words SRT (social reproduction theory) claims that reproducing life and actions that uphold life, everything from household chores to sleeping and eating, comes at a cost that capitalism does not like to acknowledge. Capitalism usually just leeches on reproduction of life, not acknowledging that capitalism cannot survive without reproductive work. ”Crisis of care” on the other hand refers to when society does not support care work, give its members time to rest and have free time and leisure. Care work is in a crisis state when it is underfunded and underappreciated in capitalism. Capitalism in one way is constantly destroying its own means to function.</P>
<P>I think art and social reproductive work have a lot in common. Social reproductive work can also be understood as a domestic work that is performed without pay or expectation of pay and the work does not calculate as a part of the gross domestic product. Sounds a lot like artistic work in my opinion. Artistic work on the other hand is usually just work that is underfunded, underpaid, people like to take advantage of it, and it also does not directly create GDB. Maybe we underappreciate both of these fields solemnly because you can not directly calculate their worth in cold hard money. </P>  
<P>Still art, just like social reproductive work, is all around us. From every book you read to every Netflix show you consume, there is at least some level of art involved in the production and product. In a modern world where we are overstimulated by media and artistic practice every single day, one cannot simply say that “art is meaningless and we should just stop giving money to artists for nothing.” Since it is not for nothing. It is for every movie, song, tv-show, youtube video, painting, drawing, you ever enjoyed in your life. It came from somewhere, from someone. Just like social reproductive work. There is always someone doing our laundry, cleaning up, making us dinner and mending our broken bones. And it comes with a price tag that also happens to be riddled with implications in gender, class and race. Because usually the ones paying for our reproductive work from their rest, wellbeing and strength are our wifes, mothers and daughters. Or women of some other family you hired to do the heavy lifting so you can spend all your time being productive at “a real job”.</P>
<P>Because still, art is not considered as a “real job”. I don’t know what we should do to change this, except maybe dismantle capitalistic values all in all in a society. You know, basic, easy things for change. I think that care and art support similar functions in society. They give us room to breathe, to be human, idle and be basically everything you could be if your existence would not be inextricably tied to labor and trying to make ends meet. Care and art is to be human at its purest form. </P>

<h1>ELEVENTH POST: THE FINAL TASK</h1>
<p>The idea for my final task is quite simple: create a spoken word audio file from poetry that is inspired by junk and spam emails and spam advertisements around the internet. The spam will be a starting point from where I gather ideas, words, sentences and turn them into poetry. In my artistic practice I am currently inspired by overlooked, vacant spaces and objects. Beforehand I have only covered physical spaces but now I will go a step forward and think what are the vacant, overlooked spaces in the web and in digital spaces. I came to the conclusion that junkmail and spam are both bypassed and overlooked products in digital spaces and I find it interesting to try to create something meaningful out of junk. Digital recycling if you will.</p>
 <p>First of all when I started to write I ran into the problem of language. Originally I wanted to write in English but all my ads and spam are in (bad) Finnish. Therefore I think I will write in Finnish since the source material is in Finnish but provide a translation even though translating poetry is unbelievably hard, but just so non-Finnish speakers can get the idea what I am talking about. Also the things I have already written (down below) are very close to some sort of weird internet dada poetry which on its own is almost impossible to translate.

<p>I ran into problems with the translation, since I didn’t have the original source material in English. So pardon me, but the translations are only approximations and they do not flow in the same way, since Finnish and English are quite different languages when writing poetry. I could have written in English from the get go, but all my source material (spam and junk mail, advertisement etc.) were all in Finnish.</p>
