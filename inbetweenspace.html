<h1>IN BETWEEN SPACE</h1>
<H2>First post. Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello</p>
<p></p>Welcome to my webpage. 
If you are wondering what is going on, I got overwhelmed by all the options 
in these ready-made website builders. 
Everything looked so fancy and new. 
And I don't really care for that to be honest.
The time will tell will this experiment be an absolute disaster or not.
I hope not. I am having an absolute blast already.</p>
<p>This blog will propably be a mix of text, thoughts, videos
(if I find a way to implement them into this code), and poems.</p>
<p>I am not a huge media consumer. Well, I watch instagram reels and send stupid
videos to my friends of course but that's about it. I don't follow the news
because they just make me depressed and sad. I much rather live in ignorance
apparently and I am quite content with that thought. I much rather consume 
slower forms of media like books and... Well actually only books since I don't
really care for movies or shows either. I watch maybe one Netflix show in 
a year.</p>
<br>
<p>Here. Have a look at this sad cat meme I wanted add to the page. It added it a bit too big but I am unsure on how to fix it yet.</P>

  <p>I am also really sorry if someone in this class actually knows how to code and create websites...</p>
<p>Best regards, Oona (14.9.2023)</p>
 <br>
<p>there is also this fancy comment box for you to write a comment. I will propapbly make only one comment box for the
whole page, so please if you leave a comment leave also a note which post are you referring to.</p>

 <h1>SECOND POST: STUDENT OCCUPATIONS AND INSTAGRAM</h1> 
  <br>
  <p>This is not the first time a university has been occupied. In 1968 a group of leftist students occupied the Old Student House (Vanha Ylioppilastalo) in Helsinki on the eve of University of Helsinkiâ€™s 100th year celebrations. On the 1968 occupation the students demanded changes to universities government policies and to the content of the studies.</p>
<p>This time around students demand basic rights as human beings and protest against the government's unfair policies and cuts on welfare, that most affect the people who are already in a vulnerable position in society to begin with like students, poor and the ill.</p>

  <p>What do these two occupations have in common? 1968 occupiers are called to be radical leftist but the occupation were said to go fluently and peacefully, and the occupiers even cleaned after themselves when they left. Yet again, the current student occupation is a very peaceful one. People are constantly told to take care of themselves, rest, drink water, eat and so on. It is all in all bodily experience to be part of the occupation. It is rough and tiresome, it is exactly what the current government wants to happen: people giving up their right to protest and being too tired to try.</p>
<p>I am interested in the thought that does these occupations change the course of government politics and stay in the history books and how much does social media have to do with everything? The 1968 occupation changed the course on leftist politics and student politics in Finland. It was also part of the larger student movement in the world criticizing for example The Vietnam war and bourgeois society. But does peaceful demonstration make a difference in the world? At least the current government really wants to restrict the right to protest in Finland currently, making it hard to get up and show up. The protesters means must match their ends. If we call for warmth, humane treatment for all and solidarity, we cannot drive those values through with violence and destruction.</p>
<p>Social media is a big part of the current occupation. It started from the University of Helsinki and spread through social media pages, mainly instagram. And now we have a nationwide protest arranged in a week and we get to thank social media for it.  I think it would not have been possible to achieve this without the use of social media. In cases like these we see social media's side and power to bring people together in a short period of time, to get excited about something and the willingness to make a change.</p>
<p>In 1968 the protests spread throughout the globe but in a much slower manner. Right now it is possible to arrange students to protest on a very short notice. I can imagine that in 1968 the occupation of Vanha Ylioppilastalo took a lot more effort and planning to execute and succeed.</p>
